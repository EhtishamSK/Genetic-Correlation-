This repository contains an R script for performing genetic analyses, specifically focused on calculating genetic correlations among multiple traits in a panel of genotypes. The script reads SNP genotypic data in HapMap format, calculates a Genomic Relationship Matrix (GRM), aligns it with corresponding phenotypic data, and fits multivariate mixed models to estimate genetic variance-covariance components. Genetic correlations are computed for trait pairs, saved as a matrix, and visualized in a heatmap for an intuitive display of trait relationships. The workflow is intended for researchers analyzing complex traits using SNP data and includes necessary data preparation, GRM construction, and advanced multivariate modeling.
